# Mathematical/Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM) 2019

I competed in ICM 2019 hosted by the Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications. 11,262 teams competed worldwide and 19 were selected to win the *Outstanding Award*, the highest distinction award possible, of which our team was lucky enough to be selected. In addition, of the 19 outstanding winner a select few were published in the *Journal of Undergraduate Mathematics and its Applications*. The paper is attached in the repository as **ecosystemservices_umap2019.pdf**.

## Introduction

Ecological (or ecosystem) services are services which are provided by the ecosystem and could be beneficial to humans. Some examples of ecological services would be carbon sequestration, water filtration, erosion and flood prevention, biodiversity protection, timber, eco-tourism, biochemical production, natural irrigation, and hydroelectricity. The diverse array of benefits provided by the environment can be categorized in many way and even the method of categorization is a contentious issue within the field [[1,2]](#1,2). Part of the problem, in addition to having a difficult time quantifying the impact of the benefits such as *biodiversity* is the nature of the magnitude of the benefit as it increases with time. Things which may be of trivial value now may have incredible importance in the future and especially the value is not only of the sunk costs in developing the land projects but in the added value as a function of time. 

We constructed a model from a combination of the TEEB dataset, physical parameters, and a review of the literature. Our final model incorporated a combination of indirect and direct use factors, the proximity of the project to urban settings, an company-specific independent eco-friendly index and the service of interest.
